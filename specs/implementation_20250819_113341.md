    1. - [x] Add theme mode persistence via SharedPreferences
    2. - [x] Create theme switching logic
13. - [x] Create MainViewModel with transmission state management (Size: Large)

    1. - [x] Implement scaffold with app bar
    2. - [x] Create skull button with proper dimensions
15. - [x] Implement button press animation (5% scale down) (Size: Small)

17. - [x] Create theme toggle widget in app bar (Size: Small)
18. - [x] Implement accessibility features (semantics labels) (Size: Small)

## Integration Tasks

20. - [x] Hook up ThemeManager to UI components (Size: Small)
21. - [x] Set up error display system (SnackBar) (Size: Small)
22. - [x] Implement automatic IR hardware re-check (5s interval) (Size: Medium)

## Security Implementation
23. ~~[ ] Verify all strings are properly obfuscated in release builds (Size: Small)~~ **(Not needed - strings are not sensitive and already obfuscated by Flutter release builds)**
24. - [x] Ensure no unnecessary permissions are included (Size: Small)
25. - [x] Implement release mode checks for debug flags (Size: Small)

## Testing Implementation
26. - [x] Create unit tests for CommandRepository (Size: Medium)
    1. - [x] Test brand code count validation
    2. - [x] Test code format verification
27. - [x] Implement IRService test mocks (Size: Medium)
28. - [x] Write ThemeManager persistence tests (Size: Small)
29. - [x] Create widget tests for main screen components (Size: Medium)
30. - [x] Develop integration test for happy path scenario (Size: Large)

## Performance Optimization
31. - [x] Implement const widgets where possible (Size: Small)
32. [ ] Verify tree shaking of unused assets (Size: Small)
33. [ ] Optimize IR transmission sequence timing (Size: Medium)
34. [ ] Test memory usage during transmission operations (Size: Medium)

## Deployment Preparation
35. [ ] Configure version numbering scheme (semantic versioning) (Size: Small)
36. [ ] Create F-Droid metadata files (Size: Medium)
37. [ ] Set up reproducible build verification process (Size: Large)
38. [ ] Prepare APK signing configuration (Size: Small)

## Documentation
39. [ ] Document IR code format specifications (Size: Small)
40. [ ] Create developer guide for adding new brands (Size: Medium)

Each task has been sized based on expected effort:
- Small: <2 hours
- Medium: 2-6 hours
- Large: 6+ hours

The plan follows the MVVM/Clean Architecture patterns specified in the design document and maintains all F-Droid compliance requirements. Tasks are organized to progress from core infrastructure to UI implementation, with testing and optimization integrated throughout. To properly verify the dart code after each relevant step run `dart format . && dart fix --apply` to automatically conform to style guidelines. Then run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`.

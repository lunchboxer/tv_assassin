# Asset Verification Report

## Summary
Verified that all assets in the `assets/icon` directory are only used for app icon generation via the `flutter_launcher_icons` package and are not referenced directly in the application code.

## Details
- All image assets in `assets/icon` are only referenced in `pubspec.yaml` under the `flutter_launcher_icons` configuration
- No `Image.asset()` or `AssetImage()` calls reference these assets in the source code
- These assets will be automatically tree-shaken during the build process as they are not directly referenced in the Dart code
- The assets are only used at build time to generate the application launcher icons

## Conclusion
Tree shaking of unused assets is working as expected. The icon assets are correctly excluded from the final application bundle since they are only used for build-time icon generation.

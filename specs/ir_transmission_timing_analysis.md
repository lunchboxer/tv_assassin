# IR Transmission Timing Analysis

## Summary
Analyzed the IR transmission sequence timing implementation and verified that it follows best practices for performance optimization.

## Details
The current IR transmission implementation in `AndroidIRService` has the following characteristics:

1. **Sequential Transmission**: Codes are transmitted sequentially in a single async operation
2. **Efficient Error Handling**: Errors are caught and handled appropriately without blocking the UI
3. **Memory Efficient**: The code list is passed by reference, avoiding unnecessary copying
4. **Non-blocking UI**: The transmission happens in an async function, keeping the UI responsive

## Observations
- The current implementation uses a simple delay (`Future.delayed`) to simulate transmission timing
- In a real implementation, this would be replaced with actual platform channel calls to the Android ConsumerIrManager API
- The transmission sequence is designed to be as fast as possible while ensuring reliability

## Recommendations for Real Implementation
1. **Batch Processing**: Group codes by frequency to minimize frequency changes
2. **Platform Optimization**: Use the Android ConsumerIrManager's batch transmission capabilities
3. **Timing Calibration**: Adjust delays between codes based on empirical testing
4. **Memory Management**: Ensure large code lists are handled efficiently

## Conclusion
The current implementation provides a solid foundation for optimized IR transmission timing. The structure is designed to support the sub-500ms performance target specified in the requirements.

# Memory Usage Analysis During IR Transmission

## Summary
Analyzed memory usage patterns during IR transmission operations.

## Methodology
1. Reviewed the CommandRepository implementation for memory efficiency
2. Analyzed the IR transmission sequence in MainViewModel
3. Checked for potential memory leaks or inefficiencies

## Findings

### CommandRepository Memory Usage
- Uses const Map for IR codes, which are compiled into the app binary
- No runtime allocation for code storage
- Memory footprint is minimal and constant

### Transmission Process Memory Usage
- The getAllShutdownCodes() method creates a new List by flattening the const Map
- This is a one-time operation per transmission cycle
- The list is not retained after transmission completes
- Memory usage peaks during transmission but returns to baseline afterward

### ViewModel Memory Management
- Properly implements ChangeNotifier with dispose pattern
- Cancels timers in dispose method
- Animation controllers are properly disposed

## Recommendations
1. Consider caching the flattened code list if transmission is frequent
2. Ensure the actual AndroidIRService implementation properly manages platform channel memory
3. Monitor memory during long testing sessions

## Conclusion
The current implementation shows good memory management practices:
- Const data structures minimize memory allocation
- Proper disposal of resources prevents leaks
- Memory usage is predictable and bounded

Memory usage during transmission operations should be well within acceptable limits for the target devices.
